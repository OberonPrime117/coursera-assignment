# coursera-assignment

My final site : https://oberonprime117.github.io/coursera-assignment/course-module5/ 
Please do check it out :) 
This was done as an assignment for John Hopkins University coursera course.

The complete work for the website has been going on for a month and I am happy to say that it works :) 
I will upload my certificate of JHU once I get it 

I would like to thank John Hopkins University and the teacher of course Yaakov Chaikin for giving me this opportunity.
