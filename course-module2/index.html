				<h2>Android</h2>
				<p>
					Android is the most open OS available. It is open source and made by Google (also crowd-sourced). The majority of the devices in the market is Android. But the phones have a less personalised hardware experience because the software is one size fits all.

				<h2>iOS</h2>
				<p>
					iOS is developed by the trillion dollar company Apple. They are designed by Apple to be specifically used in iphones. This makes the experience really good because the hardware is optimised for the hardware. Consequence of this is that iphones are really expensive.

				<h2>KaiOS</h2>
				<p>
					Lets be honest phones are getting too big and people nowadays dont use phone for just calling and messaging. But there is a viable market here which out of discipline or way of life want to use a phone which (uses surface level internet and) allows listen to music and send messages and call folks only. Nokia phones running KaiOS has been very successful , proving there is a market for it.
